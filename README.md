🍔 QuickBite Assistant
An AI-powered digital cafeteria companion built for the modern campus. QuickBite leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model (2026 update) and the Google GenAI SDK to eliminate long queues and help students make smarter, budget-friendly meal choices. 🚀

❓ What is QuickBite?
During peak college breaks, students often face:

Long Queues: Massive crowds lead to students skipping meals.

Budget Confusion: Unclear choices make it hard to stick to a daily allowance.

Late for Labs: Waiting for food causes students to arrive late for classes.

QuickBite solves this by providing a smart chat interface and a digital token system to manage cafeteria traffic efficiently.

💡 Why QuickBite?
⏱️ Real-Time Rush Indication: Visual status updates (⚠️ PEAK RUSH in red or ✅ Normal Hours in green) help students decide when to visit.

💰 Budget-Based Suggestions: AI recommends meal combos based on how much you want to spend.

🍎 Healthy Choices: Every menu item includes approximate calorie counts to encourage fitness.

🎫 Digital Token System: No more paper receipts! A digital token allows the kitchen to manage orders seamlessly.

📈 Real-World Impact: Reduces physical congestion and ensures students get food within their limited break time.

🚀 Key Features
